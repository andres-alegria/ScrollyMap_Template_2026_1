      <p>Since entering service in 2016, the Xiang Yan Hang 01, a Chinese state-owned and operated deep-sea research vessel, has gone on several deep-sea mining research expeditions, mainly in the Northwest Pacific, including the visit in June 2025. Yet, over the past five years, the vessel has spent far more time outside designated deep-sea mining exploration areas, and has instead logged extensive trips in strategic waterways from the South China Sea and Guam to the Indian Ocean and the Russian Arctic — regions that experts say could prove critical in any future maritime conflict with the United States. These missions point towards the vessel’s dual-use nature and China’s pursuit of “maritime power” — a goal that Chinese President Xi Jinping first articulated in 2012, shortly after taking office, and has repeatedly reiterated over the years. Within this broader objective, some analysts argue that China views the deep seabed, and the exploitation of its minerals, as its next frontier.</p>
